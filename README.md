# RFID-Token-Capture

## Objective: 
The College wants to take care of their students and has installed an 
RFID token capture terminal in each classroom. Each time a student enters or 
leaves a classroom, the capture terminal registers a unique token from the 
studentâ€™s phone.

Each studentâ€™s phone has downloaded an application to 
communicate with the College capture terminal. Note that the maximum 
classroom capacity is 20 students for all the classrooms.

The terminal management application saves the data in a text file 
according to the following format:

> idrfid; date; intime; outtime
